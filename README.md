# My Github Page
### This page is intended to hold the coding projects I'm creating along my journey

#### Changelog

##### v1.0 
* Created the resume page
* Used Bootstrap, Fontawesome, and FMizz for styling and making the website responsive. 
* Also added the proper meta tags, and made the style sheet for the landing page using Sass and CSS. 
* Will refine the portfolio section once I've made a few projects.

##### v1.1 
* Created the 404 page as well, made it simply redirect the user back to the landing page.

##### v1.2 
* Optimized the page a bit by minifying style sheets, adding browser caching, and adding a couple of losslessly compressed images in the favicon folder. 
* Minor fixes to the text on the page.
* Also, I know even though Github pages doesn't allow the use of files like htaccess, I will continue to update it just in case I want to move my page to another web host.
