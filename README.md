# My Github Page
#### This page is intended to hold the coding projects I'm creating along my journey

##### Changelog

###### v1.0 Created the resume page, used Bootstrap, Fontawesome, and FMizz for styling and making the website responsive. Also added the proper meta tags, and made the style sheet for the landing page using Sass and CSS. Will refine the portfolio section once I've made a few projects.

###### v1.1 Created the 404 page as well, made it simply redirect the user back to the landing page.

###### v1.2 Optimized the page a bit by minifying style sheets, adding browser caching, and adding a couple of losslessly compressed images in the favicon folder.
